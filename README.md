# wiki-styles
Pok√©mon Central Wiki CSS styles, refactored in SCSS language.

## General info
This started as a refactoring of the original [Common.css](https://wiki.pokemoncentral.it/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Common.css&oldid=482017): it was getting huge and messy; moreover, writing plain old CSS is a pain. In addition to that, thanks to SCSS superpowers, with a couple of loops we added classes for solid colors and gradients, and, last but not least flexbox styles from a specific extension have been merged here.

## Technical info
This is a [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) project, featuring an import scheme based on an _all.scss file for each sub-directory, to minimize git conflicts. A bunch of data-related libraries have been installed, and all dependencies are handled by [bundler](https://bundler.io/).

### Libraries
All libraries are from [@import](https://github.com/at-import) repositories.
* [SassyLists](https://github.com/at-import/SassyLists) ([docs](https://at-import.github.io/SassyLists/documentation/)).
* [Sassy-Maps](https://github.com/at-import/Sassy-Maps) ([docs](https://github.com/at-import/Sassy-Maps#functions)).
